                My most "struggled" project, but after the present portfolio :). <br>
                This project was inspired by the final homework of the JavaScript course with Prof. Lucian Cornianu on the BitAcademy platform.<br>
                My choice was to create an interactive map that would keep inside its borders all the searched locations.<br>
                It's a project that caught all my attention and energy. I enjoyed working on it, and I struggled a lot.
                One of the struggles was working with Google Maps API, which I learned about during the course, but it is different
                when using it unattended. Also, the dynamics of the divs that would reduce or increase as needed gave me a lot of trouble.
                The transition property and the responsive design had a play in my trouble.<br><br>
                Instructions:<br>
                The main idea is to be able to search for a location at any time, so the first map is for searching. Also, to see on
                the map all the locations you want to collect, a second map is needed.<br>
                You will see on the top left an empty "my collection" list. You cannot collect until you have searched. You collect when you "add to collection". 
                When added to the collection map, the location is added to the "my collection" list also.

                What are friends for?<br>
                I have at least one answer: they help you when in need.<br>
                So, my friend talked me into the idea of creating a color picker, for the sake of the exercise. I wouldn't see myself being able to do it,
                but he made a plan of issues, and things changed.<br>
                In the process of working on this project, I learned how to use CSS Grid and how to work with the issues on GitHub.

            <span id="project-description-2" class="project-description">
                An inspiration from a day-to-day routine...<br>
                My way to apply the learning from the HTML/CSS remote course, and the first result of my responsive design knowledge.<br>
                The fact that I created a logo that I'm proud of inspired me to succeed in making this website responsive and have the logo that
                goes responsive too.

            <span id="project-description-3" class="project-description">
                This project was my first contact with incorporating JavaScript on an HTML page.<br>
                It was like jumping in with both feet. Meeting with the MDN documentation and other oases...a little scary. But it was lots of fun,
                and also frustrating :).<br>
                ...but the satisfaction on the after...
